<h2>About Andy Hume</h2>
<p>I build web sites and web applications. I currently work for the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">Guardian</a> in London as client-side architect in the Digital Development team.</p>

<p>Over the years I've written code and consulted for clients like the BBC, Channel 4, NBC, Fontdeck, Mozilla, and eBay. Once upon a time I worked for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimap.com">Multimap</a> where I led development of their JavaScript-driven mapping site. After Multimap was acquired by Microsoft I worked as Development Lead for Bing Maps UK, managing an engineering team on products serving 30 million users across both <abbr title="Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl">LAMP</abbr> and .NET platforms.</p>

<p>Over the years I've worked on projects for Microsoft, the BBC, NBC, Mozilla, Yell, BT, Sony, Gumtree, and many others.</p>
