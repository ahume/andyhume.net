<p>At the risk of going overboard with posts about maps, there&#8217;s a couple of other things that came out of Multimap this week that I want to mention.</p>

<p>Yesterday saw the release of the <a href="http://www.multimap.com/openapi/">Multimap Open API</a>, a JavaScript interface to much of Multimap&#8217;s core mapping functionality, and the power behind mapping on sites such as <a href="http://maps.yell.com">Yell.com</a>.</p>

<p>The exciting thing about this version however is that it&#8217;s available to developers for use in mash-ups and other non-commercial projects. If you want to have a play with it, go <a href="http://www.multimap.com/openapi/signup/">sign-up</a> for a key and take a look at some of the <a href="http://www.multimap.com/openapidocs/1.2/" title="Multimap Open API documentation">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>In the final piece of map related news, <a href="http://blog.johnmckerrell.com/">John McKerrell</a>, a lead engineer on the above mentioned API, has knocked together a <a href="http://blog.johnmckerrell.com/2007/05/30/maps-maps-maps-coming-soon/">neat bookmarklet</a> which allows you to embed <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a> maps into the new <a href="http://www.multimap.com/maps/">Multimap website</a>. This means you can get the richness of Multimap&#8217;s geocoding, routing, and useful information search on top of the <abbr title="Open Street Map">OSM</abbr> map tiles.</p>

<p>With Multimap being a sponsor of <abbr title="Open Street Map">OSM</abbr>, whose to say you won&#8217;t see this feature embedded into the site in the near future. It would be a great way to deliver the <abbr title="Open Street Map">OSM</abbr> concept, and indeed the data, to the mainstream.</p>
