I even admit to making one myself in Mike's comments, but now I'm just sick of it.

<a href="http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=275">Having a Mint?</a><a href="http://phoenixrealm.com/2005/09/06/choke-on-a-mint/">Mint-rosoft</a>, <a href="http://www.robweychert.com/editorials/2005/09/03/mint_a_stats_odyssey/">Mint-Thousand-And-One: A Stats Oddyssey</a>, <a href="http://web-graphics.com/mtarchive/001640.php">The Mint Parade</a>. I wonder how long that little lot, combined, took to think up? And that's just a few of them!

However, <a href="http://haveamint.com">Mint</a>does look good. The hype is getting to me, and I kind of want to buy it, despite having Shaun's ShortStat already installed on a few sites. I don't really see what it does that ShortStat doesn't, but I'm almost inclined to feel I should have payed for ShortStat in the first place, so maybe this is a way of giving something back.

One thing's for sure, however: I won't be making any pseudo-comedy puns about tangy confectionary, fragrant herbs, or how Shaun's gonna make a <del>mi...</del> <ins>bit of cash</ins>. I recently took part in a questionnaire entitled: <em>Which puns convince you that the author is of outstanding intellect?</em> Of the ten puns presented to the participants, no pun in ten did.
