The Web standards movement has unintentionally cultivated something of a fundamentalist attitude amongst some of it's supporters. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as having extreme opinions on both sides of the argument is often a healthy sign.

However, it does mean that any good news is often rebutted with a, "Yeah, but this bit here is still crap", style of response. Fortunately these comments normally expose a limited scope of experience on the part of the commentator, which makes it very easy for me to ignore them.
