<p>One of my favourite features of the new <a href="http://www.multimap.com/maps/">Multimap website</a> is the different varieties of map data you can pull into the map viewer. Rather than just one layer of rendered vector data seen on many web-based maps, Multimap allows you to select from various other data sets depending on your location.</p>

<p>For example, if you&#8217;re a born-and-bred Londoner like me, you&#8217;re probably familiar with the magnificent A-Z style maps from <a href="http://www.bartholomewmaps.com/">Collins Bartholomew</a>. These have always been available on the web from various sites, but seeing them in all their slippy glory on a high resolution monitor is a truly glorious sight.</p>

<p>My other favourite is the classic pink <a href="http://leisure.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/leisure/ItemDetails.jsp?item=os_landranger">Land Ranger OS maps</a> favoured by walkers and cyclists across Britain. Take a look at this area of the <a href="http://www.multimap.com/maps/#t=l&map=54.47611,-3.10924|14|4&dp=841,801">Lake District</a> and try swapping between the data types to see exactly the kind of extra detail the raster maps give you.</p>

<p>To check if there are other map data-sets available in your area you can hover over the map button at the top left of the map. If data is available a small pop-out preview will appear which you can select to change the map style. The UI&#8217;s not perfect, and there&#8217;s probably a better way to expose this feature, but we&#8217;re working on that.</p>
