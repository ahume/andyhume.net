A while back (in my younger, less carefree days) I installed the <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/"> Google Tool Bar</a> in Internet Explorer as a way of checking <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/">Page Rank</a>for various bits and pieces.

Today I was doing a bit of testing in IE and I noticed that The Dredge had a Page Rank (PR) of 5. Now forgive me if I'm massively under informed about how this works, but I have always been under the impression that PR was dished out on the basis of incoming links. Well my question is this... What the heck incoming links have I got on a weblog that is effectively 1 month old?

Okay, I've got a few from various blogs I've commented on, and <a href="http://joshuaink.com">John</a>was kind enough to link in his 'elsewheres', but that can't be enough to propel me to PR 5. Can it?

I was further amused when I headed over to <a href="http://usabletype.com">UsableType</a>to see what lofty heights I might have aspired to there.

It had PR 4. Less than this place.

So, a site which pulled 80,000 visits in its first month, with links from the likes of <a href="http://mezzoblue.com">Dave</a>, <a href="http://netdiver.net">Net Diver</a>, <a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://typographi.com">Typographica</a>... well, you get the idea. Weird.

Furthermore, noticing a large influx of googlers in the stats at UsableType, I was interested, and quite chuffed, to discover <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=sifr&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=">this</a>. My sIFR article, with an awe inspiring PR of 0 (yes, zero), ranked above <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/10/26/sifr/">Dave's article</a>on the same, with a PR of 6!

How the heck does Page Rank work, and is it still relevant to anything? My experience tells me not.

Anyone noticed any similar occurences, or did you all give up on it years ago?
