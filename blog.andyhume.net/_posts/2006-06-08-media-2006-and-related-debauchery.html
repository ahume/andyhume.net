<p><a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/">@media 2006</a> is just around the corner and it's shaping up bloody nicely. In fact, next week in general is looking pretty good.</p>

<img style="border:1px solid #ccc;display:block;margin:20px auto;padding:5px;" src="http://andyhume.files.wordpress.com/2006/06/cal.png" alt="My fun packed calendar for the week beginning 12th June contains much fun and little work." />

<p>The above shows <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/">@media</a> and related events in blue, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/default.stm">World Cup</a> related events in purple, and <a href="http://www.multimap.com">work</a> type meetings in green. See what I'm saying?</p>

<p>See you there if you're attending any of this extravaganza. and if not... heh - have a nice week.</p>
