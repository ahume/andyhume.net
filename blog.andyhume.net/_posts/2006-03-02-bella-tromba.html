A few days ago saw the launch of a small web project I have been involved in recently. I don't normally use my Google juice to pimp personal projects and the like (well I do sometimes, who doesn't?), but I'd never hear the end of it if I didn't post a link to the site of the <a href="http://bellatromba.co.uk/trumpet-quartet/">trumpet quartet</a>, <a href="http://bellatromba.co.uk/trumpet-quartet/">Bella Tromba</a>.

My better half and her gang have had this in the pipeline for about the last 6 months, and finally they've got something out there. My part involved <em>seriously</em> customising <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> to fit their needs, as well as working alongside the portfolio-less H&amp;amp;W Media on much of the IA and front end code.

Anyway, job done. I can continue my evening in piece now. ;)
