<a href="http://superfluousbanter.org">Dan Rubin and Didier Hilhorst</a>, the co-founders of <a href="http://www.sinelogic.com/"> Sinelogic Press</a>,  have recently published their first e-book, "Budget Design: Increase Profit by Improving Process."

It is available for download from the <a href="http://www.sinelogic.com/"> Sinelogic Press</a>Web site in pdf format.

The book is aimed at small design firms and freelance designers, and covers every aspect of budget design; from contract negotiation, site planning, and content structure, to tips on implementing  designs in quick and efficient ways.

Many designers will be able to relate to the issues discussed by Dan and Didier. How many times do small site projects  seem straightforward in your mind, up until the moment you come to implement them? This book covers every corner of the process, helping save time and budget in ways that should make every Web developer think about the way they work.

I was a fan of this book from the minute I started scrolling, and would recommend it to anyone working in Web technology. Let's face it, there are always ways in which we can improve our efficiency at work, and cut down on wasted hours - and wasted monies.
