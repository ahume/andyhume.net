<p>This week, the W3C announced that work is stopping on XHTML 2.</p>

It always had to be evolutionary and not revolutionary. Revolution comes at a time when you're stuck.

<h2>Revolution or evolution</h2>
<p>The mistake that was made, and that many people realised at the time, was that the W3C were trying to precipitate revolution when they were not empowered to do so.</p>

<p>HTML serialized as XML is a worthy goal, and one that continues with XHTML 5

The W3C aren't in a position to drive revolution like that. Certainly not with a technology as well established and successful as HTML.</p>
