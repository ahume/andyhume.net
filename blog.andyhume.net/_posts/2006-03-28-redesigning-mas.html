An idea I often toyed with when starting Artist Logs was taking some of the more high-profile sites in the classical music industry and performing unsolicited redesigns of them. It's a phenomonen that's been seen quite a lot across the web, most notably by 37signals and their <a href="http://www.37signals.com/better">37better projects</a>.

At the time I was working much more as a performer, and I think I was aware that in the cut-throat industry I was attempting to earn a living in, I should probably keep my voice down when it came to criticising colleagues over their web presence.

That was then; and this is now.

The MAS website has long been a site I thought could do with a bit of an overhaul. I think the original design was circa 2000 and it had not been updated or even freshened up since then. For a 2000 design it really did its job quite well. OK, it was using frames which caused the obligatory havoc with search engines and bookmarking, but in general the architecture was well defined and you could find and use what you wanted quickly and with relative ease.

I was quite excited when I heard through the missus' circles that the site had finally undergone a redesign. On checking it out however, I was distinctly underwhelmed, and even shocked that they'd actually managed to go backwards.

I really don't need to spell out the most obvious flaws. They clearly need to invest a little time and money on some simple branding. Although their purple colours are effective in print, I'm not sure it's ever going to look that great on-screen. And what is that pair of legs doing dumped in the middle of my screen? If you haven't taken a look yet, please do.

With MAS their is a clear conflict between their brand on the web and their standing within the music profession. As a former client I can say that their efficiency, reliability, and professionalism, combined with their friendly manner and smart, pleasant staff, put them second to none within the industry. There is not a chance you would come to that same conclusion from an isolated look at their website.

They are suffering from the same malady that many small businesses in the music industry suffer from: the assumption that they can roll their own website for little or no money at all.

Their reposte to my line of questioning would clearly be that their reputation preceeds them, and this is true. 99% of their business undoubtedly comes from word-of-mouth, so perhaps the return on investment for an expensive web prescence would be negligible.

My answer to that is, I'm not talking about an expensive web presence. I'm talking about spending a few thousand pounds on a clean and professional design that <strong>supports</strong> their image, rather than detracts from it.
