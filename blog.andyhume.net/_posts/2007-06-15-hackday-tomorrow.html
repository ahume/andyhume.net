<p>I'll be up at <a href="http://www.alexandrapalace.com/">Alexandra Palace</a> tomorrow at the <a href="http://www.hackday.org/">BBC/Yahoo! Hackday</a>. I'm excited about it even thought I haven't really got any plans or ideas for things to work on. The atmosphere at this amazing venue should be pretty special, and I can't wait to see some of the cool stuff that is going to be created over the weekend.</p>

<p>Having said that, if anyone's got a need for some web development skillz, or in-depth knowledge of <a href="http://www.multimap.com/apidocs/">mapping API</a>s,  give me a shout. I'm probably going to have to get involved somewhere or they might just chuck me out.</p>

<p>See you there?</p>
