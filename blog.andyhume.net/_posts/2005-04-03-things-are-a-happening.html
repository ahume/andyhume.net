I now work full-time at <a href="http://multimap.com">Multimap</a>.

This is a very good thing, and I am really excited about not only working with the thoroughly nice fellow  that is <a href="http://clagnut.com">Richard Rutter</a>, but with what seems like an extremely nice team all round.

So... I'm not self-employed anymore. I'm not a freelancer. Excellent.

I have been self-employed for the last three years (since leaving higher education) and although the freedom can be really nice, many parts of the freelance life-style can be very stressful and frustrating.

I've always read these "I'm going it alone" type posts with a smug sense of knowing amusement. Yes, there is a lot to be said for the control you have over your life - but sometimes it is very hard to live when you have too much control. For me, one of the hardest things about working from home is seperating work-time from play-time, or more to the point computer-time from non-computer-time.

I know I am looking forward to having a slightly more rigid structure to my day, even if it is not much more than 'going to work' and 'coming home from work'. These are important boundaries in anyone's life, and to have them blurred can be a frustrating and even dangerous thing---although we won't go in to that here.

The hope now is that I can come home from work, relax a little, and even indulge in my small vice that is <a href="http://www.sigames.com/">Football Manager 2005</a>, without pangs of guilt about not finishing a project proposal or a style guide, that <em>"only needed another hour's work"</em>.

<h4>The other thing</h4>

The other thing is that I am planning a re-design of this site. Not just a re-design either, a whole re-concept. Are you excited yet?

I need to figure out exactly what I want from a personal site. What is it going to be? Right now it is just a very minimal blog with an about page. Originally I thought this was what I wanted, but over time I have added little bits like the 'recently dredged' links, and I think it wants to evolve into a fully fledged 'personal site'.

I'll try and document some of the process behind my thoughts here over the next few weeks. Not neccessarily because anyone is interested in them (although I'll leave comments open), but because I like recording these things for posterity.
