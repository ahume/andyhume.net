<p>It's about this time of year I start to feel a bit <a href="http://thedredge.org/2005/03/off-to-sxsw-today-not/">left out</a>. I've been telling people I'll do my best to get to <abbr title="South by South West Interactive Festival">SXSW</abbr> this year, but in the last week I've realised it's definitely not going to happen. It just doesn't fit in with how the month of March is panning out.</p>

<p>Anyway, inspired by <a href="http://www.muffinresearch.co.uk/i/seemedrink.gif">Stuart's take on the event</a>, and in an effort to keep up with the banter and buzz surrounding the build-up, I've knocked up a little banner for those of us who will be there in spirit.</p>

<img src="http://thedredge.org/i/seemenot.gif" alt="See me not. SXSWi, 2006" style="margin:10px auto;" />

<p>I would have put it in my side bar for all to see, but... er, I don't have a sidebar. Feel free to wear it with pride though.</p>
