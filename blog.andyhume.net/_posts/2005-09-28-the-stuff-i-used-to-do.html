A few people recently have been asking me about my past life as a musician. This seems to be because I wrote a few words about it in my <a href="http://thedredge.org/about/">about section</a>, because I rarely talk about it at work or anywhere else. I also write a post a few weeks ago about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Tippett">Michael Tippett</a>.

The answer that satisfies most people is 'Yes, I really was a professional orchestral musician'. Actually, that sounds weird even to me now. What I find more odd however, is how little people know what a job like that might actually entail on a day-to-day basis.

There are lots of really good and bad things about being a musician.
