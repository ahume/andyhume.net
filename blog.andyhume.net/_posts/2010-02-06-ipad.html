<p>I stand by what I said from day one. Technically, it&rsquo;s a big ass iPhone. But the iPhone is really a pretty magical device. And this is a big ass one.</p>

<p>Here follows my prediction for myself and the iPad.</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s impossible for me to buy one, I don&rsquo;t really want one. I certainly don&rsquo;t need one. There&rsquo;s no obvious gap in my computing armour that it will fill.</p>

<p>That is, until the day it becomes possible for me to walk to a shop and buy one. Otherwise known as the UK release date. On that day, I will almost certainly walk to said shop and buy one.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not proud of myself.</p>
