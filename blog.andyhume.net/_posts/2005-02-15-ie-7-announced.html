However disappointed we may be when we actually get to see <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/02/15/373104.aspx">this thing</a>, you have to admit that it is a step forward. I mean what's the worst that can happen? Standards support can't go backwards (can it?), and surely we'll get full CSS 2 and PNG support.

So I welcome the announcement; at least for the time being.
