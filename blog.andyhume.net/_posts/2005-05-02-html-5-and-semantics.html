The <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">HTML 5 spec</a>contains:

<strong>2.7.4. The small element</strong>

Now, it appears that the WHATWG people have decided that this means:

<em>"The small element represents small print (part of a document often describing legal restrictions, such as copyrights or other disadvantages), or other side comments."</em>

Now, is it just me or is the <strong>small</strong> element not a particularly semantic way of saying, "this might be a copyright notice... then again, it might be some kind of legal thing, or maybe just a side comment".

Small to me is presentational, in the same way that the <strong>b</strong> and <strong>i</strong> elements were presentational.

I understand that 'small print' has a semantic meaning in terms of a legal document or contract. But it just seems wrong to use it in a <strong>mark-up</strong> language.

Any thoughts?
