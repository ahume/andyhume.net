The problem with having a strongly held opinion is that it is self-perpetuating. Your brain, often unconsciously, does more and more to consolidate that opinion. You consciously look for things that prove you right, and subconsciously gloss over or discredit things that might prove you wrong.

For instance, when an atheist reads the writings of Richard Dawkins or Sam Harris they hear calm voices levelling sensible and convincing arguments. If they read the likes of Francis Collins or Alister McGrath (on religion at least) they simply hear propaganda and self-delusional circular arguments that lead to no reasoned conclusion.

The problem is, it's almost certainly the same for the other side. I know certain evangelical Christians to whom you can't even utter the word Dawkins without them reeling off a tirade of accusations as to his legitimacy and reasoning. If they read his work they hear nothing but a bitter, angry man who offends them with his lack of sensitivity and understanding.

Your brain shuts itself off to the opposing argument in an attempt to consolidate your own position. And the nearer the extremes of the spectrum of opinion you are, the stronger this phenomenon becomes. Once you have started down the road of unshakeable belief in an idea it takes conscious effort for you to back away and re-evaluate.

Think how arse-over-tit 

This is why I'd rather not have an extreme opinion on anything. You are putting yourself in a position where it's difficult for you to judge the truth. You're using more than just facts and experience to motivate yourself in arguing a point. You start to use pride, stubbornness, anger; and in real extremes, threats and violence.

If you're espousing an opinion, and your saying things without thinking them through, plucking half-conceived ideas from the air in support of your position, and remonstrating with tuts and groans, then stop: you might be arguing on the wrong-side, and you might, deep down, already know it.
