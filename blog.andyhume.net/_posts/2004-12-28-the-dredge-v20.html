Welcome to the re-design. Well more than a re-design: more of a re-launch.

I am now proudly powered by <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>1.3. This version is still not in beta, so before you rush off to download it be aware that it is not quite ready for public consumption yet. I was intrested in testing some of its new features and thought the the redesign of this place was as good a place as any to give it a spin.

<div class="update"><strong>Update:</strong>
Okay, it seems I am actually using WP 1.5 Alpha 6. I'm more cutting edge than I ever could have imagined... (I'll be using <a href="http://usabletype.com/articles/2004/how-and-when-to-use-sifr/">sIFR</a>next). The development team appear to have bounced the version number up from 1.3 to 1.5. I wonder why?</div>

For anyone subscribed to feeds here, my apologies for the hideous mess you will have experienced this evening. I have no doubt that there are better ways of implementing a site wide CMS and CSS update, but live editing felt so much more exciting.

Version 2.0 has been christened <em>Dockshite</em> and nods to a building in Docklands, London, that I spent a bit of time in leading up to Christmas. It was tall, minimalist, and very shiny. All the graphics come from one photo taken in a glass lift.

Incidentally, if anyone has strong feelings about some of the content that has gone missing from The Dredge, <a href="/contact/">drop me a line</a>and I will port some of it in to the new database. If not, I won't bother because I'm not really missing it.
