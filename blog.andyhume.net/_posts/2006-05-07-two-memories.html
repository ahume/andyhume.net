<h3>Highbury</h3>

Wednesday, April 24th, 2002. Nwankwo Kanu's header, and our second goal of the night against the Hammers, in my eyes clinched the 2002 Championship for us.

<h3>Dennis</h3>

Our second against Fulham at Craven Cottage in 2003. Driving run through the centre of the park, and hit from 20 yards. Dennis at his peak: quite literally untouchable.

Thank-you and goodbye, Highbury.

Thank-you and goodbye, Dennis.
