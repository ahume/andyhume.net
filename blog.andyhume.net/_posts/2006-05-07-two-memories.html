<h3>Highbury</h3>

<p>Wednesday, April 24th, 2002. Nwankwo Kanu's header, and our second goal of the night against the Hammers, in my eyes clinched the 2002 Championship for us.</p>

<h3>Dennis</h3>

<p>Our second against Fulham at Craven Cottage in 2003. Driving run through the centre of the park, and hit from 20 yards. Dennis at his peak: quite literally untouchable.</p>

<p>Thank-you and goodbye, Highbury.</p>

<p>Thank-you and goodbye, Dennis.</p>
