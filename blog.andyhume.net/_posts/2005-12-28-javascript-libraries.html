I keep reading about Javascript libraries. More specifically, <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>and <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous</a>. For those not familiar with these frameworks, they are simply Javascript files, which when included in your web pages allow you to add <em>"easy-to-use, compatible and, ultimately, totally cool"</em> effects to your web pages. Ahh... beginning to sound familiar?

If so, it's because you may have done a very similar thing, some time back in the nineties.

When the hype of DHTML first came about, developers could avoid learning the intracacies of Jacascript and the DOM by  simply 'pluging in' certain files and feeding off the work of other developers. Now, there's absolutely nothing wrong with doing that in principle, and good software engineers will always learn from the work of others. However, the problem comes, in my opinion, when you are plugging in code that you just don't understand.

I was lucky enough to attend a workshop organised by the fantastic <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com">Carson Workshops</a> team recently. <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/dev/fuchs/26JAN2006.html">Getting started using Ajax</a>was a very interesting day delievered by Thomas Fuchs. Thomas looked at...., and there was a lot of interesting and thought provoking discussion which came out of it.

What let the day down however, was that 95% of the practical examples Thomas gave were based around the Prototype framework. A framework that 95% of developers there will not be able to use in their day-to-day work. I know if I went back to <a href="http://multimap.com">Multimap</a>and said I wanted to include nearly 2000 extra lines of code in a page that sees over 6 million impressions a day just so I can do a bit of Ajax, our Service Delivery team might have a little something to say about that. I imagine it's the same at the BBC, IBM, and many other high traffic sites who had developers attending the workshop.

Recently, <a href="http://allinthehead.com">Drew McLellan</a> wrote about <a href="http://24ways.org/advent/easy-ajax-with-prototype">Easy Ajax with Prototype</a>on the festive delight that is <a href="http://24ways.org">24 Ways</a>. It's a great article for someone who wants to start getting their head around using Ajax, and the theory behind it, and indeed just 'plug it in' to their page.
