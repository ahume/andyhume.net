Apple released the 2nd major upgrade to the OS X Tiger operating system on Tuesay, and after reading reports of generally good install experiences and excellent performance gains I took some time out to install it this evening.

After the 93MB download, I can report one more smooth installation and a rather nice performance boost. The first thing I checked out was Safari passing the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/act/acid2/test.html#top">Acid 2 Test</a>. Not only does Safari pass that web standards mile stone in this latest version, but it definitely feels snappier than it has in the past---which is no mean feat.

The application I was most worred about was Mail.app. I'm very picky about the way my mail is recieved and stored, probably because---after BBEdit---it's the app I spend the most time using on a day-to-day basis. All my plugins, inlcuding <a href="http://www.bronsonbeta.com/mailappetizer/">Mail.appetizer</a>, <a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailTags.html">Mail Tags</a>are still working perfectly.

Everything is Rosy with the world, so if you've been waiting for a few glowing endorsements of this upgrade then here's another one you can add to the list.
