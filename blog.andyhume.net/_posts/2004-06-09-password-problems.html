Here's a good one!

This afternoon, I managed to post a rather sensitive password on to a very busy community's web forum. A forum, that many <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>users may well be familiar with actually, as you're all very busy on it.

Anyhow, after a 30 minute password recovery project - involving a quick visit to a server admin panel, ftp clients, and the like - I popped back to the 'forum' to see exactly what, in my stupidity, I had done.

Perhaps it's just me , but there is something about the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/2#newtopic">login interface</a>that is slightly confusing. It seems  a little tied up with the whole 'new post' thing. Maybe it could be moved above the 'new topic' <code>&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;</code>, or perhaps to the bottom near the submit button. May suggest it to <a href="http://www.photomatt.net">Matt</a>.

What's ironic of course, was that I was already logged in - hence the message being posted - and didn't even need to enter any passwords.
