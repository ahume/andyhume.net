HTTP is the protocol that enables the delivery of web pages, the flow of data, the . It's where the user touches your web site or your web service. It's the neurones of the World Wide Web, joining and transmitting your bits between the fundamental building blocks.

When I say Understanding HTTP, I don't mean the eight request methods; I don't mean the numeric status codes, or the most common HTTP headers. As a web developer you will understand all those things, but there is much more to understanding HTTP than those things, and not everybody gets it.

HTTP is very important. That's what you need to understand.

The effect of HTTP impacts web development far beyond the request/response cycle it enables. In fact it's difficult to think of an area of web development (beyond just writing code) that it doesn't impact. Web browsers and web servers

<h2>Performance</h2>
The golden rules of client-side performance: Reduce requests, compress responses, unblock JavaScript, reduce cookies, sprite images. All of these are derived from understanding HTTP and how HTTP requests effect a web browser.

<h2>Ajax</h2>

<h2>Web Service APIs</h2>


The architecture of HTTP is a hugely empowering one. It's a key factor in the Web's rise to what it is today, and what it will grow into in the future. Why? Because it empowers people to put things together; to make things. It might be a simple web page with embedded hyperlinks, images, video, or audio. It could be a rich Ajax application with asynchronous requests to disparate datasources from all over the web. It could be Google sending robots to index the web.

If you make your services available over HTTP then people will take them and make bigger and better things with them. Sometimes those people will be you. I've worked in environments where robust, well-documented Web APIs were the norm, and I've worked in environments where they haven't been. The difference in flexibility, innovation, robustness of systems, and overall output is astonishing.

If you're trying to build a business on the Web then you need to Understand HTTP, why it is your friend, and why it can help you create amazing things.
