I'm trying out <a href="http://adaptivepath.com">Adpative Path<a />'s </a><a href="http://measuremap.com">Measure Map</a>, so come in and use my blog.

First impressions of this tool are pretty good. Dead simple to install, mainly because the whole thing is hosted remotely for you. The only set up you have to do is add some Javscript calls to a site wide include (ie, footer), and to your post loop and comments loop. Takes 5 minutes, tops.

Anyway, leave some comments, have a look around my kinda pathetic blog, and basically get me some stats. I don't get massive amounts of traffic here by any means, so perhaps I should have put this up on <a href="http://usabletype.com">UsableType</a>to test it out, but it's here now so get stuck in you loyal few! If it's worth checking out, I'll let you know.
