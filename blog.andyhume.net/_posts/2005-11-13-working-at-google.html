I've got a friend that's been working for <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>recently, and he says the employee benefits are just amazing. Check out what the company is sorting him out with since he's been working there, it really is amazing.

<ul>
<ol>We all know this one, but employees get to spend 20% of company time on their own projects - which I guess is kind of cool. At least you've got an answer when people come around and say, "Everytime I pass you Andy, you're posting to your blog!".</ol>
<ol>If you need time off work to say, take your car for a service, then they have someone that can take it for you - and bring it back!</ol>
<ol>They provide free lunch for you everyday, and if you happen to be working late - free dinner too!</ol>
<ol>Got a bit of a dodgy back from spending too much time in your chair? Just give a quick call to the in-house gym and they'll send up a masseur to give you a back massage - so you don't even have to leave your office!</ol>
<ol>How annoying is it when Apple bring out new hardware just weeks after you've just been bought a new Power Mac? Really annoying that's how much. So Google get round this employee frustration by buying you the latest Apple Hardware everytime an upgrade is released! My friend has had 3 new Power Books in the last year, and he's well pleased.</ol>
<ol>A lot of Google geeks don't have the time to get out and meet women much, so Google help you out with that as well! When you join the company, you fill in a questionnaire detailing your preferences, and once a month they get hold of a load of girls that want to meet geeks and bring them along to you for an interview. Many Google employees have met future spouses like this.</ol>
<ol>
</ol></ul>

These are just a few of the things my friend mentioned to me today. I'd tell you the rest but I've got to catch a train (damn... if only I worked for Google!), and I can't be bothered to make any more up. Google soooo rocks!
