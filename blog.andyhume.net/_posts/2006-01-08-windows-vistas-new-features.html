A couple of <a href="http://tauquil.com/archives/2006/01/06/re-introducing-the-real-windows-vista/">amusing movies</a> over at <a href="http://tauquil.com">Tauquil.com</a>help to remind everyone why we just have to laugh at Microsoft evey now and again.

And before anyone slates me as a Mac fanboy, I have no problem with MS including these kind of features in their operating system.  They are great features that every modern OS should have. But for the love of God... <strong>why</strong> do they try and make out that these are innovative features that will be new to the personal computing world?

Will Vista have anything that will make me look and wish Apple would incorporate something like that in Leopard? Have they done nothing new?

Actually, what would really make me chuckle is if MS demo something truly innovative, which Jobs is able to pinch off them, build in to Leopard, and ship <strong>before</strong> Vista!
