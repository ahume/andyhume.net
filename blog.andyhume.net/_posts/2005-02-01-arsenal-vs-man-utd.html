Is it me or is it more important that there's a damn good fight at Highbury tonight, rather than a good game of football. I want us to stuff United as much as the next man, but anyone listening to BBC Radio 5 commentary would think it's some kind of fantasy wrestling match about to take place.

Keane vs. Viera, Rooney vs. Campbell, Henry vs. Ferdinand. The BBC's already reported an 'incident' in the tunnel before kick off. Gimme a break.

There were more chat about the referee and how he should handle the match, rather than any kind of tactical talk. No wonder I don't want to watch Sky anymore these days. I bet it's far worse.

Anyway, on the upside we appear to be all over them in the opening 5 minutes.
