A very cool little app I discovered today is <a href="http://gdisk.sourceforge.net/">gDisk</a>. gDisk is a little upload client that allows you to er... upload files to your gMail space.

I never use gMail as an email client and I doubt I ever will, but now I can take advantage of the 2.5 GB that are sitting there doing nothing.
Heck, if I run out of space I can just move over to another account. That's better than a kick in the teeth, or a Ã‚Â£60 .mac account! NB: Yes I know .mac does more than just that.

Anyway, it's handy for casual back-ups as well as sharing between machines. <a href="http://gdisk.sourceforge.net/">Check</a>this one out.
