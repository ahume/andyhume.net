I've been a friend of <a href="http://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a> from day one, when <a href="http://clagnut.com">Rich</a> left me on my own at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimap.com">Multimap</a> to go and start his new venture in 2005. Pretty much from that day I've had the thought in the back of my mind of whether I might one day end up working there. To be honest, I thought the right moment had probably past. But when Rich asked me at the end of last year whether I'd like to apply for the job, other events were conspiring to make it exactly the right time for a new start. Those conspiring events are for another post (possibly); but in essence, a lot of things were up in the air, and it felt right that they land in Brighton with a new job at Clearleft.

I'm in my second week there now, and it's been a lot of fun. I've learnt a ton from working alongside <a href="http://natbat.net">Natalie</a>, and have really enjoyed getting to know those from the team that I'd not previously had the pleasure of meeting. It's exciting to work alongside people that I've admired for a long time; indeed, some of the people that inspired me to become a web developer back in the day. I say that <a href="http://brendandawes.posterous.com/ive-got-to-say-this-the-uk-web-design-scene-i">totally unashamedly</a>, because it's true.

I've been commuting down from London the last week, which has been a pain. But from next week I should be a permanent resident, enjoying my daily walk to work (<em>walk to work</em> - did you get that?) and meeting the people that make Brighton's geek scene what it is. If you're part of that scene, look out for me, and say hello.

So here starts a new chapter. It's exciting and a bit daunting, but I feel refreshed and very happy to be here. I'm pretty sure Brighton is one of only a handful of places I'd have left London for; and I'm completely sure that Clearleft is the <em>only</em> agency I would have left Microsoft for.
