Just a quick question. Over at <a href="http://artistlogs.com">Artist Logs</a>I have a form that allows people to email blog posts to friends that they think will find them interesting. Over the last few days I've started to get a lot of "Mail delivery failed" messages from unknown severs to my email account, and it looks very much like my scripts are being used to send unsolicited email from my server.

Is this a common problem, and what can I do to get around it? Do I have to resort to checking for human interaction with the form (ie, 'What colour is an orange?') or perhaps use some javscript to keep out bots?

Any advice?
