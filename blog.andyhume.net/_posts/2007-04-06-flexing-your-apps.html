There&#8217;s been a bit of chat recently around things like <a href="http://www.danwebb.net/2007/3/20/flash-vs-ajax-it-s-time-to-expand-your-toolbox">Flash vs. Ajax</a>, the <a href="http://domscripting.com/blog/display/102">The Ajax/Flash continuum</a>, and other similarly stirring topics. I&#8217;d been thinking a little bit about the same sort of stuff myself, and indeed I weighed in at Jeremy&#8217;s blog in a rather non-committal fashion (if that&#8217;s possible), throwing the best-tool-for-the-job line out a few times.

Of course I&#8217;m significantly hampered when trying to make a point in this argument by the fact that I have got pretty much bugger-all experience when it comes to Flash. So last weekend I decided to address that problem a little bit.

<h3>Why would you want Flash?</h3>

I think the crux of Jeremy&#8217;s argument is that if you&#8217;re going to define JavaScript as a base-level technology for your application, then you&#8217;re not using JavaScript for what it&#8217;s best at: progressive enhancement of structural, meaningful markup. If progressive enhancement is not part of the plan at any stage then perhaps you should reassess why you&#8217;re using JavaScript in the first place?

This all ends up pointing me towards <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex</a>, a <q>powerful application development solution for creating and delivering rich Internet applications</q>. At <a href="http://multimap.com">work</a> that&#8217;s what I do&#8212;I create rich (often overly rich) Internet applications which require JavaScript for you even to be let in. It&#8217;s this situation where it appears that Flex <em>might be the better option</em>, so that&#8217;s what I downloaded and filled my weekend with.

<h3>First impressions?</h3>

Now, I&#8217;m the kind of person that gets very excited when I&#8217;m learning new skills and technology, so I need to keep some perspective when talking about Flex. Firstly, I&#8217;m having a good time learning it, and I&#8217;m impressed with the speed and ease with which you can actually achieve things. It wasn&#8217;t too difficult to put together a very basic and crappy <a href="http://media.usabletype.com/myflex/rss.swf">RSS reader</a> within a few hours (although why it&#8217;s 255K is a little odd), and the feeling you get when you realise it&#8217;s going to work in every browser on every platform without you even having to think about it, or even test it, is nice&#8212;to put it mildly.

Secondly, I&#8217;d somehow picked up the false impression that I had to use Adobe&#8217;s own tools to write my code in. This isn&#8217;t the case. I can write the XML, CSS and ECMAScript (all these standards!) in <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> or any other editor I want. The only piece of Adobe software I&#8217;m using (aside from Flash in the browser of course) is a small command line script that compiles my application into a .swf file.

It doesn&#8217;t really feel like you're entering a whole new world, and I got into some productive working habits quite quickly. There&#8217;s lots of concepts that those coming from browser based client-side development will be familiar with. It is of course all XML, CSS and ECMAScript, and the separation of content, style and behaviour is very much encouraged - if not enforced - within your applications code.

<h3>My problem with it?</h3>

I guess it sounds a bit naff; but it simply doesn&#8217;t excite me like the web does. In fact it doesn&#8217;t feel like part of the web at all. I want the semantics of HTML, the power and richness of <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a>, and the potential for others to build on top of and extend my application with tools like <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a>.

Flash by it&#8217;s compiled, closed nature doesn&#8217;t offer this and it&#8217;s hard to envisage a world where it ever will, despite Adobe&#8217;s moves to open it up with tools like Flex. I love that I can build Flash apps with standards like XML, CSS and ActionScript, and there&#8217;s no doubt that it takes away a lot of the pain of building web applications in the browser. It&#8217;s just that the end result never feels quite right to me.

However, now I&#8217;ve dived in a little I&#8217;m going to keep going. I&#8217;ve ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Guide-Flex-ActionScript-3-0/dp/1590597338/ref=sr_1_1/202-6781994-4960637?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1175872434&amp;sr=1-1">The Complete Guide to Flex 2 and ActionScript 3.0</a>, and I&#8217;m going to see what it takes to build the kind of applications I&#8217;m used to developing in JavaScript.

Most of all, I&#8217;ll now be able to join in the Flash vs. Ajax arguments with a little more professional integrity&#8230; or something.
