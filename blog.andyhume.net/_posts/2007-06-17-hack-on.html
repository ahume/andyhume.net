<p>It's coming up to five O'Clock in the morning at Alexandra Palace. I'm still going stong to be honest, but I know I'm going to be frazzled in about 12 hours time.</p>

<p>There's still a fair few fellow hackers up and working, but plenty of others scattered around the floor and the walls of the West Hall. Most trying to leverage two odd shaped bean-bags into various sleeping tools.</p>

<p>The atmosphere has been great all afternoon and evening. It was clear it was going to be a memorable day from the moment lightening struck the mast on top of the palace, accompanied by a huge explosion. The windows in the roof of the hall then proceeded to open and flood thousands of pounds of equipment with rain water. That was proceeded by a few hours of Wi-Fi free activities while BT fixed us up again.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to work for me. I'm building <em>something</em>. I've totally forgotten what it's meant to do though. It's got a database and a textfield I think. And some blue in it.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It didn't have any blue in it (that was a weird thing going on with <a href="http://clagnut.com">Richard's</a> Mac Book screen), but it must have had something, as it was awarded the Yahoo! Most Useful Hack Award (or something like that). That was a bit of unexpected fun at the end of a very long and inspiring two days.</p>
