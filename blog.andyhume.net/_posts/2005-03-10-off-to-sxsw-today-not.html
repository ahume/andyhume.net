Today I am (not) off to SxSW. My flight from Heathrow to Austin (is not) boarding in a few minutes time and I can't wait to (not) meet loads and loads of you fascinating people.

My schedule for the weekend is (not) busy, but I am planning to (not) get as much networking in as possible, so please (don't) come and say hi if you recognise me.

Wow. I feel much better for posting that.
