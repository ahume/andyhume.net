What's more, perhaps a redesign is on the cards over at the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a>? After all it's a pretty tabley, non CSS affair at the moment; but <a href="http://usabletype.com">UsableType</a>gets a dozen or so referrerals a month from the New York Times secure development server, on their 'HTML + CSS Links' page.

That's pretty cool I reckon?

So if a beautiful standards compliant site pops up in the next few months, you'll know who to thank, right? ;-)
