This kind of thing probably happens all the time, but today was my first real experience of it. Let me put you in the picture.

I recently spent a good few hours of <a href="http://artistlogs.com">my time</a>doing a little work for quite a well known weblog in the US. The result of this was a fairly detailed typographical report, and some new style sheets for the look of the text, headlines, footer, etc. These were received with great delight by the client, who said he would immediately apply the recommendations to the live site. Everything was good.

However, on a quick visit today, I notice that one small thing has been changed in the styles. It's a <strong>really</strong> small thing, but in my opinion (which is what I was paid to give) my version was a hell of a lot better.

Why do people do this? Spend all that money getting the expert (ahem...) to fix things, and then at the last minute  decide that they know better. Frustrating to say the least.

As I said, this kind of thing probably happens all the time, and maybe I'll get used to it. But it does raise an interesting question.

Can having a credit and link to a designer---or design company---on a popular site have potential disadvantages as well as benefits?

The benefits are obvious as the link is essentially a referral from that client and could bring more work your way. But what happens when in a year's time, the site has had so many bits added, and bits taken away, and other 'little changes', that the whole design just doesn't work anymore? It probably won't be such a good advertisement for you then.

Any thoughts on this?

To any designers reading this: do you normally ask for credit on a site? If so, do you monitor the site now and again and ask for the credit to be removed if the design has slipped, or been corrupted in some way?

Comment away people!
