Garrett Murray of <a href="http://www.maniacalrage.net">Maniacal Rage</a>has found a use for all  <a href="http://www.thedredge.org/archives/2004/06/26/the-fuss-about-gmail/">the fuss about Gmail</a>.

I have donated my remaining Gmail account invitations to him. So if you are still after one, please <a href="http://www.maniacalrage.com/archives/2004/06/moregmailaccounts/">visit him</a>, and consider a donation to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Let's use the hype to do some good.
