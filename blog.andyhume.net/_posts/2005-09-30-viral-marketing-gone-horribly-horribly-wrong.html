I wouldn't normally write about something like this, but my asides don't work, and this deserves attention.

I read, as do probably a number of you, <a href="http://plasticbag.org">Tom Coates' blog</a>. This means I have been following the story of him contacting his father for the first time.

Some weeks ago he received a letter from his father. The first contact between them ever. He wrote about this on his blog in the same honest, natural way he always does.

A few people left comments. One person left this comment:

<blockquote>"Hi Tom, Always remember one thing. Life is very, very short and nothing is worth limiting yourself from seeing the ones you love. I hadn't seen my father in 15 years until 2 years ago. I was apprehensive but I kept telling myself that no matter how estranged we'd become there was no river to wide to cross. Drop me a line if I can be of any more help. Cheers, Barry"</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.barryscott.blogs.com/">Barry</a>, thouroughly nice chap that he appears to be, is a marketing vehicle for <a href="http://www.cillitbang.co.uk/">Cillit Bang</a>. What the buggery fuck is the world coming too.
