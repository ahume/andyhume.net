Regulars will notice the slight change to the layout and feel that I've just made. This site is back to what it always used to be --- a blog. Pure and simple.

Actually, the reason this completely unscheduled change has just been made, is probably worth mentioning. In short, while doing a little bit of server tidying, I came across the first mock-up I ever made of this <a href="http://thedredge.org/2005/06/yeah-yeah-i-know-audi/">'Audi inspired' design</a>. It looked pretty much like what you're looking at now.

I took one look at it and thought, hmm... that's rather nice, why the hell did I spoil that by adding the side bar and all the extras? This is particularly relevant due to the fact that I never even used the side bar. The external links where all "Lorem ipsum', and for some reason the 'latest post' loop wasn't populating. Basically, it was a complete waste of space.

So, it's gone - and I'm back to a similar concept as in the previous design, dubbed 'Industrial Minimalist' by <a href="http://joshuaink.com">John Oxton</a>. Anyway, I like minimalist --- if you've got fuck all content it really is the way to go.
