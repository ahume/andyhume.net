<div class="update"><strong>Final Update:</strong>
I've finished my tampering with this for now, and am confident it is infallible everywhere you look. Even Netscape 7 and early Mozilla's are playing now. We'll see how it goes. Thanks for your help.</div>

Yes, I have a <a href="http://shortstat.shauninman.com/" title="Short Stat by Shaun Inman">stats package</a>, and I am aware that my current readership here is, well... quite low.

However, I hope to get at least a few replies. This is the question:

Can you see (if you have the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash">Flash player</a>installed and Javascript enabled), three flash replacements at the top of this page? The first saying <del>'Some Worries',</del> <ins>'Slight Concerns'</ins>, the second showing the date, and the third requesting 'Can I ask a favour?'.

Yes or no? Please comment below with details of operating system and browser if possible.

I thought I had this pretty much sussed, and tested pretty much everywhere, but today I got a frustrating shock when I decided to show a friend the new design at his place. The top title was nowhere to be seen. Stupidly, in my anxiety I forgot to note the browser and OS exactly. I know it was Opera on Windows, but apart from that... nothing to go on.

Incidentally, I don't want this to turn in to a comment farce about the pros and cons of sIFR and indeed Flash. I'm not actually interested in that - heard it all before. All I am interested in knowing is whether these replacements are working for <em>you</em>.

Cheers.
