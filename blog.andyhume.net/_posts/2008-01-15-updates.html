Multimap was <a href="http://www.multimap.com/press/press_releases/pr185_microsoft/">acquired by Microsoft</a>, meaning I'm now an employee of the big MSFT. Wowza, where did that come from?

I've just spent the last week getting very excited about a software update for my favourite piece of hardware. New features, UI improvements, all downloaded from the comfort of my living room, via iTunes, to my... <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">phone</a>. My phone?! When did I give a crap about software on my phone? Strange times we live in, huh?

Ed parsons is saying extraordinary things <a href="http://www.edparsons.com/?p=609">about Open Street Map</a>. "Mapping data needs to be comprehensive", which is like saying "We need world peace". Yes, we do! Fortunately, he <a href="http://www.edparsons.com/?p=613">talks some sense</a> when it comes to the BBC's streaming <a href="http://bbc.co.uk/iplayer">iPlayer</a> which rocks and has really screwed up my New Years plans of getting a few early nights.

Happy New Year to everyone.
